# Quantum Algorithms for Optimization  

ðŸš€ Grover's Algorithm Implementation  

Welcome to the world of Quantum Computing! This project showcases the power of Grover's Algorithm, a quantum search algorithm that outperforms classical counterparts when searching unsorted databases.

# Project Description  

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of Groverâ€™s Algorithm using Qiskit. Groverâ€™s Algorithm is a quantum algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems compared to classical algorithms.

# Objective  

* Implement an efficient algorithm to search data faster in an unsorted database
* Apply Grover's Algorithm as an optimized quantum search technique
* Solve classic search problems using quantum circuits
* Explore the potential of quantum computing for optimization problems

# Technologies Used

* Google Colab- Cloud-based coding and collaboration
* Qiskit (Aer)- Quantum circuit simulation and execution
* Qsim-	High performance quantum circuit simulator
* Matplotlib / Seaborn-	Visualize quantum states and results

# How It Works  

* Define the oracle to mark the correct solution
* Apply Grover iteration (oracle + diffusion operator)
* Measure the quantum state to retrieve the marked element
* Visualize measurement probabilities and quantum state evolution
