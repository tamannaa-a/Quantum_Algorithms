# Quantum_Algorithms (Quantum Algorithms for Optimization)

DESCRIPTION:
Implementation of Grover's Algorithm 
This project demonstrates the implementation of Grover's algorithm. It is designed to search an unsorted database faster than the traditional methods. The project demonstrates the design and implementation of the circuit.

OBJECTIVE:
To find efficient algorithm which helps in searching data faster in an unsorted database
Using Grover's Algorithm as optimized search technique
To solve search problems in an efficient way

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Google Colab
Qiskit(Aer)
Qsim
Matplotlib/seaborn(for visualization)
